### Some Courses I am taking this quarter: 

- CSE 110

1. CSE 101

4. BILD 4

My favorite programming language so far has to be `C++` due to its efficiency and my extensive practice with it.

> “C++ is designed to allow you to express ideas, but if you don't have ideas or don't have any clue about how to express them, C++ doesn't offer much help.” -random quote I found online on C++ 

Some of my goals for my second-year of college include:

- [x] Maintaining a strong GPA
- [ ] Having a project listed on my resume
- [ ] Exploring research opportunities in Bioinformatics

Here is the relative link to a screenshot of my first ever labwork in CSE110!
